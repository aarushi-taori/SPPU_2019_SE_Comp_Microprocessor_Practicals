Practical 1 : Write an X86/64 ALP to accept five 64 bit Hexadecimal numbers from user and store them in an array and display the accepted numbers.

Practical 2 : Write an X86/64 ALP to accept a string and to display its length.

Practical 4 : Write a switch case driven X86/64 ALP to perform 64-bit hexadecimal arithmetic operations (+,-,*, /) using suitable macros. Define procedure for each operation.

Practical 5 : Write an X86/64 ALP to accept five 64 bit Hexadecimal numbers from user and store them in an array and display the accepted numbers.

Practical 6 : Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5- digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user friendly to accept the choice from user for:  <br>(a) HEX to BCD <br>b) BCD to HEX <br>(c) EXIT.<br>Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (Wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers).

Practical 7 : Write X86/64 ALP to detect protected mode and display the values of GDTR, LDTR, IDTR,
TR and MSW Registers also identify CPU type using CPUID instruction.

Practical 8 : Write X86/64 ALP to perform non-overlapped block transfer without string specific instructions. Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.

Practical 9 : Write X86/64 ALP to perform overlapped block transfer with string specific instructions Block containing data can be defined in the data segment.

Practical 10 : Write X86/64 ALP to perform multiplication of two 8-bit hexadecimal numbers. Use successive addition and add and shift method. (use of 64-bit registers is expected).
